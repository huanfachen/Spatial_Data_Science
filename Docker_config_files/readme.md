The files in this folder will facilitate the use of Docker image sds2022 and VSCode.

To use these files, you can copy the folder of **.devcontainer** and **.python-test.code-workspace** to the root folder of the project, and then run the **.python-test.code-workspace** file, either by double clicking it in the file explorer or use `wslview .python-test.code-workspace` in WSL terminal.
